# Racial_Classification_XAI_Model
### Introduction
* This is a simple guide on how to train the model on my branch



##### train model
* go to config folder to change your save_paths
* src.model_trans.py is the tranfser learning one. I obtain high accuracy using this model. I slightly changed the model structure
* src.training.py is how I train the model. I'd included a CSVLogger to keep track of my training stats and store it in .csv form
* run_age.py loads every necessary scripts and perform training

I think it is better to just pull all my file to your branch and run the run_age.py script. Because I modified quite a lot of stuff. Make sure to run my code with my docker, it will work!

##### picture
* This folder contains the heatmap generated by integrated_gradient. The result looks great with the newly trained model!
